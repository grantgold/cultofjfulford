I’m in Fairfield, Iowa today on instructions from our leader JFulford. It’s a cloudy and cold 23ºF. Last night I stayed at a Super 8 Motel ($58) on the West side of town across the street from the Sinclair tractor supply shop. For breakfast I called the front desk and asked a lady named Joanne for a recommendation. When I hung up I just wish I recorded the call, because at 7am for breakfast she suggested the Pizza Hut on W Burlington Ave.

I chose to come to Fairfield because I know a few lovely people who grew up here, who have told me about their fairly unique schooling experience… where meditation was taught as early as elementary school. An odd place for it, but Fairfield is the U.S. home of Transcendental Meditation, or TM (the copyrighted meditation program developed by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi).

Unsurprisingly however, the city is the nation’s largest producer of construction warning signs. In the mid 00’s TrafFix Devices Inc. expanded their California based production to Fairfield by building a massive facility only about a mile from my hotel. Today they produce over 100 different cautionary traffic and construction signs, using a device bought for this factory back in 2010 called a Graham Model GEC-7460 dual head blow molding machine. This state-of-the-art machine lowered color changing times from 8-12 hours down to 1 and made it possible to produce all of their products on the same machine.

You may not consider your relationship with their products regularly, but you probably know them intimately. This photo represents a small sample of TrafFix’s sign solutions. Like grown-up toys, they’re brightly colored and oddly shaped, with blinking lights, and eccentric cartoon personalities. If you live in a city they surely feature in your daily life, but sadly these bright and shiny objects have a hard time fitting in. Travelers tend to take photos that leave them out of the frame because they don’t feature in the advertisement photography they generally mimic. The next time you see them out in the street, please try to make them feel better about their bright colors and charming characters. Take a photo that includes them and makes them feel at home.
