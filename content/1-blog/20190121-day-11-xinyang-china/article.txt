Extensions of the sea on land, my flight over China was dusted with clusters of blue roofs that caught my eye. First the blues, then the reds I noticed, no one seeming to give the same answer as to their significance. “Blue is royal” they say, “blue is industry” they say, “blue is longevity” they say. Windless cold. Pale dirt on the trails delivers grassy viridescence in the province that I arrived. Xinyang in Henan. Dried, earthy greens of Xinyang MaoJian tea leaves that grow in the yellow and black soils of the mountainous Xinyang region. 

In search of some Xinyang MaoJian green tea to sample, I came across a seller called Zhuhai Xinyang Food Co. Their stock, I found, was mostly packaged and heavily preserved foods, foreign and domestic. 

Pressurized plastics and airless pockets squeezing with every bit the intensity that comes when you hold your breath and tighten your shoulders. Sausages and oils, crushed tomatoes and cooked dough, turkey and condensed milk. Heely Food distributes Zhuhai Xinyang Food Co.’s products. Their available merchandise was all documented by photo and sold via taobao.com, a subsidiary of Alibaba. Watermarks grace their cataloged products as signs of legitimacy. A highly desired quality in China, indeed.

My puppy dog delight when I took note. Fluorescent-lit packaged goods tinged of yellow and photographed on beige backgrounds. One after the other. The delight came not from hunger or pleasurable sense of taste but for the same soft coos one feels in their melting arms, the cuddle of newborn innocence. At 45º an adorable baby child softened the glow of mildewy product photography as a watermark. 

Giggly smile of some loving parent’s winsome baby, distinguishing thousands of food products as legitimate. We may never know this child, but he shall be recognized by the unquantifiable online buyers of tea, canned tomato, meats, cooked dough, turkey and condensed milk, oils, yeasts, sugars, mayos, breads, and noodles.
