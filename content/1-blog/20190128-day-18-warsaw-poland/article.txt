I’m in Warsaw to pay tribute to the artist Henryk Tomaszewski, a Polish painter and designer who passed away in 2005; One of the main inspirations that drew me to New York to study graphic design. 

At the time I was at Texas State University learning the craft of etching and serigraph printing under the tutelage of the artist Jeffrey Dell (a friend and mentor). And during some inspiration hunting came across some of Tomaszewski’s work for the Nowy Teatr (New Theater) in Warsaw. Striking, saturated colors light the dim and faded fathoms I had at the time of Poland and eastern Europe. My silly American stereotypes of harsh grimness in the defeated and crumbling cement landscape envisaged from my history books with stories of Nazi invasion and communism.

The military controlled the world of arts and entertainment in communist Poland, even publishing (link: https://www.discogs.com/label/578083-Wojskowe-Zak%C5%82ady-Graficzne text: vinyl records) from the 60’s–80’s. And while Tomaszewski is quoted agnostically as saying that “politics is like the weather… you have to live with it,” he was irritated by the bureaucratic system and came up with inventive ways to circumvent censorship. In 1983, after the victory sign was prohibited from being made in public, Tomaszewski cheekily made a poster with a foot giving the sign instead.

His work consisted mainly of posters for events and publications in the arts, all bearing the printer’s mark ‘W.Z. Graf.’ Since first seeing the mark over 15 years ago I presumed it the name of the printer, so I decided to find them while I was in town.

In my search I found that W.Z. Graf was the signing name of Wojskowe Zakłady Graficzne (which translates roughly to “Military Printing Plant”). Formed in 1953 on order by the Polish Ministry of Defense, W.Z. Graf later took over printing for the Department of Internal Affairs in 1962 which included a separate part of the facility to be reserved for the printing of classified materials. 

Next to the old printer there was a record shop called Vintage Vinyl, I smiled and walked in.
