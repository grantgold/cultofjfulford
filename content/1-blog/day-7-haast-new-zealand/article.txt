After starting my day at the Heritage Park Lodge in Haast, New Zealand I drove North on the Haast Highway which traces the western coast along a shore of scenic cliff outlooks, lush forests and watershed rivers from the mountainous terrain to the south east. 

The points of lookout, like a slice of Joe’s pizza, left me wanting just a slightly bigger bite. I chose to enhance my view with the cheapest of 5 helicopter tours provided by HeliServicesNZ ($99 for 10 minutes along the coast). 

Through the fog three criss-crossing lines, etched into the earth not a mile from shore, made up a landing field. Haast Aerodrome, still operational and owned by a local named Laurie McGuire, was listed for sale recently in the Otago Daily Times (the local newspaper). $20 landing fee as verified in November 2018 by the Aeronautical Information Publication of New Zealand. 

The view was stunning but since I didn’t take any photographs I’m including one by an airman named Paul Beauchamp-Legg, taken in 1958 of the same approach that I saw facing the airstrip from the north west. Likely taken while flying his DH.89 Dominie from his home in the Marlborough Sounds. 

I did however manage to take some video from my helicopter ride which you can see in the links below.
