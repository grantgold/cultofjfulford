Balenciaga sweaters, Aesop soaps, and Supreme skate decks. Big paychecks, celebrity, 1,000 likes, and fancy titles. Take them all away for I am no shaman. I cannot yoke the strength of those totems and their merit fills me like a trash bag, needing replacement once a week. Born on my skin the desires of all those come before, knotted up in a miserable and helpless “I”, illusions about myself contaminated by the illusions of others.

I am here today in Uruguay to celebrate its 40th President, José Mujica. He has been described as “the world’s humblest head of state,” donating 90% of his salary to charity and living on the wage of an average Uruguayan citizen, noting that he does not advocate for poverty, but for sobriety. Reflective of the horrible values that our society projects, the major papers refer to him as the world’s “poorest” leader.

Along the coast I walked a symbolic 12 hour journey from Punta del Diablo (Devil’s Point) to Agua Dulces (Sweet Water) in tribute to the 12 years that Mr. Mujica spent in prison, previous to his work as a civil servant. I sought awareness and gratitude and found sobriety in every canteen here. Awareness abound. No billboards here, no hypnotizing telecast of vapid and deathly grins. Those scenes of sad people, insultingly insincere, insecure. Borrowed stories of greatness, creativity, divinity. Salesmen of happiness cannot provide access to the mountain tops and the supremely sad cannot buy connection to the depths of their souls. 

I'm attaching an image of José Mujica and his wife in his 1987 Volkswagen Beetle. It was worth $1,800 in 2010, the total value of his mandatory Personal Wealth Declaration before becoming President.
