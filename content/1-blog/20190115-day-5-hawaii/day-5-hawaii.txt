Title: Day 5 - Hawaii

Text: 

Ken Love, an educator and advocate for local and diverse tropical fruit growers in Hawaii designed a poster displaying the wide variety of avocados grown on the islands (over 30 varieties). With almost half of Hawaii's avocados rotting on the trees while 1.5m pounds of California and Mexico avocados were being imported, Ken used pamphlets, posters, and proselytizing, to educate the public on the local varieties. Teaching them how to cook with the different types, which had more oils and fats, how to pick the right ones, and even how to farm better ones. 32+ years of research and advocacy, documenting better farming and harvesting techniques for all tropical fruits. And yet the most internationally publicized story about avocados in Hawaii is about Pamela Wang and her Guinness World Record for largest avocado.
