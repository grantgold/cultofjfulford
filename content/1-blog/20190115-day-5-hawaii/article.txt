Ken Love. I found his name credited at the bottom a poster featuring over 30 varieties of avocado in Hawaii. Another one featured over 45 types of mango and a full alien world of others like egg fruit, ice cream beans, poha berries, cherimoya and breadfruit. 

Ken is an educator and advocate for tropical fruit growers in Hawaii who’s spent the last 33 years educating the public on the different types of native fruits in order to prevent waste and to keep the variety thriving. A study in 2007 showed that almost half of Hawaii’s avocados rotted before being eaten while they imported over 1.5m pounds of them from California and Mexico. Ken prepares research and documents optimal harvesting and storage techniques for farmers and leads an initiative called the Tropical Fruit Growers of Hawaii. 

All this is to say that the most internationally publicized story about avocados in Hawaii focuses on Pamela Wang for her Guinness World Record for largest avocado.
