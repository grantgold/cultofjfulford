Our school library had a fairly extensive collection of films which was always getting bigger thanks to the film department. In my time there I would discover a new director and go through their films one by one until I finished or got bored with their work. One of the most stirring of those directors for me was Abbas Kiarostami. *Taste of Cherry* in 1998 made Kiarostami the first and only Iranian to ever win the Palme D’or. I remember at the time finding reviews of *Taste of Cherry*, which Roger Ebert called “excruciatingly boring.” 

*Taste of Cherry* is about a man who wants to commit suicide, driving around Tehran in search of someone to bury him. The film is composed of long and sometimes empty shots. Empty of action, empty of reaction, and empty of points-of-view. He is driving around the countryside picking people up, explaining what he needs, that he will pay them. When they turn him down he sits quietly and thinks. 

Those long, vacant periods of time; outside, quiet, thinking, are what drew me to Tehran. They reminded me of my childhood in Colorado, escaping outside to sit in the woods for hours. Wind, twigs rattling, bright sounds of my polyester jacket scraping against evergreen needles. Near nothingness. A flight to freedom from abandonment, freedom from terror, freedom from the sounds I focused on. Outside I was on my own, imagining a self-sufficient hero inside to encase and protect me. Where I could hide myself. Where sounds I made were soft and quiet, and no one could hear them but me.

In Laleh Park, past Tehran University where Kiarostami studied art and design, I sat near the Kanun theater where he produced his first film. Prowling for food, some abandoned street cats walking inaudibly, on high alert to the movements of those around them. Behaviors learned from instincts of survival keeping them from mental relief, freedom, God.
