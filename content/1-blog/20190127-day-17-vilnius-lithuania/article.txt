Poet Aged Seven, a poem I read this morning, reminded me to take a break. So my day was spent sitting in Elska Cafe sipping the unmistakably global taste of premium ground espresso beans in a familiar rounded ceramic mug.

Last year I heard a rolling and funky bass with cult-like vocals squawking a blared line of repetition, “hare krishna, hare krishna, hare hare hare hare!” We were in Phonica Records in London and I looked at Rod, eyes wide, “who is this?” The shop clerk handed me the album. A 12” mix of 3 songs under the label Multi Culti from Montreal, Canada. Another track on the mix was by an artist called Manfredas, titled Mani From the Block, that put me on the floor. 

Manfredas’s music has a distinctly human sound that feels as deep as bones; tribal. Forming groups of people into pulsing and synced vibrations, rooting you down into your most basic sensations. He runs a club night here in Vilnius called Smala at Opium Club and even though he wasn’t playing tonight I came to check it out on the assumption that the club attracted like-minded musicians. 

Video art exalted like a crowd at a christian mass, projected TV feedback, interlaced pinks and greens. Soupish flow in beat, every texture warm and tingly fuzzed. My coat also now, a useless thing. Hesitation lacking in swinging of arms, my body guides me and I do not respond or react, I allow it safe passage. One second of blissful connection, one breath of illuminated fog. I fear nothing.
