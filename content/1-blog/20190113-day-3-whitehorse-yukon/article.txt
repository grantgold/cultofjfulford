“Oh, I love it when it does that. May not be flying anymore but this is pretty darn close” says Murray Lundberg. An old DC-3 airliner spins around on a stand hovering above the ground in front of the airport.

The first time Murray was here in 1985 a young man fueling his plane said that the old DC-3 was the world’s largest weather vane. “Slowly and silently, the graceful old lady shifted position until she was again pointing into the wind, as if hoping for just one more takeoff, one more flight over the incredible wilderness that surrounds the capital city of the Yukon Territory.”

Whitehorse, the largest city in the Yukon, has been home to Murray since 1990. His poetic and extraordinarily detailed history – every year from 1942 to 2009 – of this taxidermied plane, and an article I once read in BOYS LIFE, are what drew me to the Yukon.

For the last 40 years Murray has prolifically chronicled Alaska, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and northern British Columbia with an insatiable curiosity. His website explorenorth.com boasts over 6,800 pages and 40,000 photos which document all things local. Flora and fauna, locally spotted vehicles (land, sea, and air), local biographies, cemeteries and graves (several thousand), local cultural histories of postal service, military, and mounted police, and even films, photographs and stories set in his locale.

He also keeps up a local news blog, noting his discoveries and daily findings as well as listing local fires, new road signs, and even documenting which plane Governor General Julie Payette (the former astronaut) flew in on her first trip to the Yukon this last November. It was a Royal Canadian Air Force Canadair CC-144C Challenger (CL-604).

There is a certain kind of presentness that people like Murray have, a fascination with minutiae that represents a passionate love of life. Appreciating every savory morsel using every delicate sensitivity they have. Today I’m paying attention to the direction of the wind. (Attached photo by Murray Lundberg)
