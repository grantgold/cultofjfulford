Pelted waters recall the rains of yesterday, showers of ethnographic slapstick-like scenes from a Jean Rouch film as the giant trunk whips it’s spraying hose around toward me. Guilty in my enjoyment of this “exotic” experience. It’s 8AM and I have arrived early along the Periyar River to help clean the elephants as suggested by my taxi driver, Mr. Battacharjee, who picked me up at Cochin Airport. 

Chains hold their legs after we bathe them in the river. They rock back and forth. Georges Frei, author of the Elephant Encyclopedia, says that this rocking behavior begins when the elephant is not able to engage in some stimulating interaction like free movement or comforting contact with another. If after some time it is still not allowed to satisfy this key stimulus, the circle of disappointment begins again and the elephant may degenerate to a sad, frustrated creature.

Recalling my tucked head, seated on the kitchen-floor, shouts and hands swinging above me, I can’t understand what they’re saying but my body is tight. Impermeable, rocking. Arms hugging my knees, vacuum-packed, compressing so small that I disappear into thin air and I am become someone else. I am still there now. You can hear me call out when I sing a song from back then, but we have never really met.

I feel camaraderie. With their tough satsuma skins. Monumental ability, stifled and choked by others, powerless to directional tugs. Tied up in deep rumins of thought, nostalgias of chasmic pain and trauma, I have coarse and sparsely spread hair too.

As the handlers place bejeweled fabric masks on the elephant’s face and wrap their trunk with beads and flowers, I feel their hurt and a different rain befalls me.
