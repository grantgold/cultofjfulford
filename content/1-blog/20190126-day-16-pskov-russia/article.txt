One of the oldest cities in Russia, once an all important border town marking the gates to Europe, flanked by fortresses, Pskov reminds me of the small city of Nancy, France where I stayed for a couple of months in school. A modern bus system, paved roads that make New York look like a shanty town, grand avenues skirted by colossal trees, and well kept parks and landmarks. 

I came on the recommendation of my friend Francis and spent the night at Mirozhsky Monastery. The priest wore a gilded cape that stood stiff like the metallic outfit worn by the Dada poet Hugo Ball in a photo I love from his Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich. After a service surrounded by beautiful frescoes I took a 2 hour journey south to the home of Aleksander Pushkin.

From Russia my grandmother bought me a military side cap covered in little pins, one of them featuring Alekander Pushkin. While Pushkin is a compelling character, the subject of the story is not him but the Mikhailovskoye where he was exiled. It was built on land granted in 1742 by empress Elizabeth to Abram Gannibal (a kidnapped African and adopted godson of Peter the Great). Pushkin’s mother was a granddaughter of Gannibal and kept Pushkin there during his exile in 1820. The state purchased it from Pushkin’s son before it was burned down in the October revolution of 1917. Four years later it was and rebuilt as a museum and state monument. During WWII it was looted and mostly destroyed, later given in 1992 to the Russian Orthodox Church and rebuilt to its present form with a monastery in 1995.

Rebirthed at least 3 times, I wondered which part of the structure was original. The wooden exterior, the doric-like columns, the landscaped fields. Like many historic structures it has been tended by countless keepers and builders, each bringing their own care. Scratching unique lines in the wood, marking the floors with their distinct footwear, extending the essence of the house. Elements reforming, mutating, evolving; originals fascinate us, but they are illusive along the spectrum of time. They do not exist.
