Wales, Alaska; known as Kingigin by the native Iñupiaq people who have lived here on the Bering Strait for more than 6,000 years. It is the westernmost point on the North American continent. While visiting the area I came across this photo that appeared to feature a man walking in the air.

Taken in the spring during Nalukataq (translation: ‘to toss up’), a festival for good fortune in the next year’s whaling hunt. By marking the hunt with an ending they attempt to respectfully calm the spirits of the whales that were killed and celebrate the success of the whale hunting season. After the meat is cooked and everyone is fed, the younger whaling hunters stretch out a wide blanket of walrus hides and hoist up the leaders of the hunt and their wives, flinging them into the air, giving the festival its name.

During the blanket toss, some people practice *ivayaliq. lvayaliq* is the act of giving a gift on behalf of the gift-giver’s baby boy. This giving is supposed to bring luck to the little boy and make him become a good hunter. It will also bring success to him in later life. The jumper will often put their gifts in a bag and open the bag when they are tossed into the air, allowing the gifts to shower over everyone below symbolizing their ability to provide for others.

I thought of the power of gifts. When we receive a gift, no matter how small, there is a subtle feeling of indebtedness. Many have used this to their advantage, but I feel it is something deep within us that is good. It reflects our innate ability to work together for mutual benefit. Someone who gives you flight is surely deserving of a gift.
