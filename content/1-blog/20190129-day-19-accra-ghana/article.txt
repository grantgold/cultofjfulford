The depth of absorpt discernment, through a mask of previous explorers, I have come to see my infinitesimal opportunity for understanding as microscopic. Layers of translation flowering wrinkled and leathery-creped petals of history told to me by those gone before. A salient reminder that my consciousness is the net at the bottom of an elephantine language filter; the last page in a book of stories by prospectors and globetrotters who speak in understandable tongues.

Today I am in Accra, a city on the south coast of Ghana, the former capital of the British Gold Coast which was the result of Britain, Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, and France’s attempts to dominate the production and harvest of cocoa. During this time of colonial dominion, a natural phenomena of cultural coping manifested itself from the histories of traditional spiritual practices. The Hauka who derived their rituals from local tribes along the Niger River evolved the use of cult-like possessive trances to reflect the new colonial seats of power. 

In 1954 Jean Rouch, a French pioneer in ethnographic film, was invited to film the annual ceremony of a small group on a farm a few hours from Accra. During the ritual, participants enter possession through various spirits associated with western colonial powers: the general, engineer, doctor’s wife, wicked major, and the corporal of the guard. They foam at the mouth to signal their possession and begin to enact an interpretation of a colonial ceremony. Rouch’s film *Les Mâitres Fous* documents the full ceremony down to the gruesome detail of skinning and eating a dog. Afterwards, we find the partakers working their daily jobs in Accra.

A powerful act of coping with domineering forces. The Hauka seem to be subjugating the western colonial mechanisms of power by allowing themselves control over something they are powerless to stop. Acknowledging powerlessness; an absent fragment of our western culture that affixes a load to our shoulders. Today I am conceding my ability to control my life and relieving myself of responsibility. I am powerless to shape my life and wouldn’t be happy with the life my societal mask has shaped. Let the possession begin.
