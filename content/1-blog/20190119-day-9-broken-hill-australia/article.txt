Broken Hill, a mining town in New South Wales, Australia. I came here much in the way that foreign tourists often choose locations; one of my favorite films was shot here. Wake In Fright, a psychological thriller from the 70s that failed commercially had developed a cult reputation in Australia by the 1990s and Broken Hill played the role of Bundanyabba, or “The Yabba” as it is referred to by the drunken, Two-Up loving locals in the film. 

“TWO-UP”, a sign shouted from the side of the road where I came across the Palace Hotel. I was doubly attracted to the hotel for it’s New Orleans style architecture and the shadowy and cool sight of it’s under-awning, which, in the stalled summer air, lured me in for a refreshing drink. Turns out the Palace is the only pub in all of Australia to be licensed for Two-Up.

If you don’t know what Two-Up is, it is essentially a coin toss game. A traditional game honoring soldiers former and present on Anzac day. “Come in spinner!” Two pennies or coins are set on a piece of wood called a “kip”, and tossed in the air by the “spinner”. The spinner bets on whether the two coins will land heads, tails, or “one them” — one of each of them — and the rest of the “school” places side bets.

Surrounding the coin tossing in the Palace Hotel are over 500 sq meters of all-encompassing murals commissioned by an Italian migrant, Mario Celotto, who purchased the building in the 1970s. Aside from a recreation of Boticelli’s Birth of Venus on the ceiling (by Mario), the murals were painted by the aboriginal artist Gordon Waye (who won the project to fill the interior with his paintings), featuring a serene oasis of landscapes in a yawed dimensional view providing impossible but beautiful scenes of imaginary rivers and waterfalls. 

In the Barrier Daily Truth (local newspaper) I read about 3 women seeking out the stories they had heard of an artist in the family. They had traveled to the Palace Hotel to see the work of their distant relative, Gordon Waye, and were putting together a book of their aboriginal family history called “The Way Back” (the ‘e’ was added when Gordon was put in a type of shelter as a child).

Below you will find the article I read in the Barrier Daily and a photo of the 3 cousins as well as additional research about the hotel's history and current status.
