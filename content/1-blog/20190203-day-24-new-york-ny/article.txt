A few months ago I learned the story of a man who is walking every street and path in New York City; more than 8,000 miles. His name is Matt Green and he has been pursuing this goal since January 1, 2012. I sent him an email thanking him for his inspiring story and since he is still walking, I asked if I could tag along. 

We started on the south east corner of Central Park where he had a number of small meandering paths to pick up and after walking them we began lapping the East 60s back and forth, coming upon a number of different discoveries. The beautiful iron work of the Trinity Baptist Church doors on 61st, the Day & Meyer Murray & Young fireproof storage building for the valuables of the wealthy, the Dutch windmill logos on the Queensboro bridge, and the old Queensboro bridge market with its Guastavino ceiling tiles. 

Rafael Guastavino was an architect who came to the U.S. from Barcelona and, along with his son, developed and patented dozens of building techniques and products, including the Guastavino tile arch system. An interlocking layout that allows a curving between arches of rectangular tiles based on a Catalan vault. This arch system, however, used thin tiles instead of bricks, resulting in a stronger and more lightweight reinforcement that acted as a sort of skin over the underlying structure. Spread out pillars of the well-known, joined above in arches of diaphanus connections, spiderwebs gluing together lighter stories than the sturdy tales of their columns. 

Seemingly disparate stories bridged by deeper awareness, this journey peeled open opportunities for discovery that feel endless. Curiosities that birth meaning and searching that emphasizes the supreme value of being present.

The final day of my trip; I am home. Please let me know how you have responded to this project.
