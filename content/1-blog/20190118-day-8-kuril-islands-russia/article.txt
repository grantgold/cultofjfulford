No structures, signs, roads, or almost any signs of human life. In a place as empty you would expect to find nothing to learn about, especially without any visible literature or materials of information. 

Lo, I have found mountains. 

Stepan Petrovich Krasheninnikov, a Russian explorer and naturalist in the early 18th century gave the first accounted description of the Kuril Islands as well as the Kamchatka Peninsula to the north east. An account he made between 1731-42 based on his expedition there as an assistant with Vitus Bering (for whom the not-so-distant strait is named). 

On the string of Kuril islands I was drawn to Ushishir (partially connected to Yankicha) for its thermal activity and the numerous fumaroles and lava domes where the earth cracks open to release its steamy and gassy insides. If cells splitting independently and continuously forever causes the evolution of life, then volcanoes are the cell splitters of hard rock and elements that evolve the non-living masses of Earth. 

Because of the difficulty in getting here, I enlisted a crew. My guide, Dr. Tom Pfeiffer, has studied volcanoes for over 30 years. We were surrounded this morning by fog and snow at about -5ºF, the airy quiet and tranquility of a sauna in reverse cooled my restless thoughts of existential, Earthly movements. The views into deep concave valleys and cliffs pushing out over the edges of the ocean inspire awe and a spell of dizzy coalescing tingles behind my ears.

Throughout our day we found a range of wildlife, from the rare white orca that we saw on our brief paddle out from shore, to eagles flying above and a whiskered auklet that we caught in hand. (Video of the orca and photo of the auklet that we caught below).

This rim of islands are the peaks of deep sea mountains forming from the rifts where gasses steam and lava oozes. While seemingly random, their marks on the Earth line the edge of the giant North American plate that has been at work since the Earth was formed. No different from the moon and mars, the Earth is simply on a timeline that leads to stillness and dust. But in my short life I will enjoy seeing these islands of Earth creators, where mountains burst from the ocean, and our little darling Earth spreads and stretches out in her teenage growing pains.

I’m attaching a graphic I have marked, showing where the tectonic plates lineup in relation to this area.
