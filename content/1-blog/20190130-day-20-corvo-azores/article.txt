Milking froth of wet salt, deep brine of bone-scratching cold, the strength of 24,901 miles. Azores high, Bermuda high, pressure systems over Atlantic stretches, sky-clearing clockwise movement. I am on Corvo Island in the Azores, around 800 miles off the coast of Portugal. In the world of East coast surfing, the Azores are known to me for the high pressure system, the Azores high, that is named for them. It sits in the Azores area of the subtropics during winter and moves over Bermuda (Bermuda high) in the summer, pushing cyclonic systems from Africa South and West, keeping them near the equator until they reach land in the Americas.

I am at the westernmost point of Corvo Island today to breathe in the winds that guides waves to my home in New York. Wind is a lovely and poetic instance of the interconnected fabric in the universe, carrying energy by way of sound, light, solids, liquids, and gasses; it is easy for us to see and feel its effects. However, the vibrations of movement on a scale of millions of millenia, cast across the galaxy, arriving to pound against the shell of our atmosphere; we are not made for this kind of sensitivity. Vibrations swaying light and magnetism, temperatures and cloud cover, the movement of Saharan sands across the Atlantic that land in Texas by way of hurricane. The expanse between my finger and thumb no different than a mile, no different from an ocean, no different from the distance to the sun.

That connection is, for me, the higher power that rules the world.
