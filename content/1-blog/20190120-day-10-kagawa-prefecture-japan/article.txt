There is a pilgrimage of 88 temples on Shikoku Island (the number 8 is associated with prosperity in Japan). People in white outfits can be seen all over the island walking their pilgrimage in and out of temples in their sedge hats, mostly touring these days by bus and train instead of walking. 7 being the luckiest number in Japan, I stopped at temple 77; Doryu-ji on the north shore. 

Doryu-ji was founded in 749 as an act of repentance by a man who accidentally shot his nurse with an arrow. Each Buddhist temple is associated with a Honzon representing the worshipped deity and the Honzon of this particular temple is one named Bhaiṣajyaguru. In one of the two main branches of Buddhism, Bhaiṣajyaguru is the Buddha of healing and medicine, and as someone in search of healing, this was about as lucky as I could get. 

In the spirit of the 88 temple pilgrimage around Shikoku I decided to consider my past, taking my own 1-day pilgrimage starting with a ferry in Kagawa that led to nearby Awashima (which takes roughly one day to walk around).

Pilgrimages of the past or ancient world. Of stories, of myths. The search for healing. Quiet reflection and surfaced memories from deep drawers and out-of-reach recesses. In my safe place, oblivious of the adventures to come, I was stirred with a call to action that whined the sound of a distant hum. And, believing it my imagination, took 16 years to see the shell that has encapsulated my past. Finally I am ready to scratch at its surface in search of the dried, soft pith that can be pulled back in search of my inner child.

I'm attaching a japanese translation that I made of Joseph Campbell's steps of the hero's journey. A myth that reflects life’s great adventure in all of us.
