Green bumped fabric, orange red, clay pot blues, knotted white tassels off stripes from colored blankets hanging over “BOLIVIA” tooled leather messenger bags and shrink wrapped sugary nut candies gleaming shiny red dusts and almondine brown. Satchel bag stuffed puppets, llama fluffed silhouette chords, knit dressed maracas. Tchotchkes sans plastic, sans “Adam”, sans “Sarah.” Ducked entry to an alley; mausoleum. Spanish villa entryway haloed of recto-lined rock, flanking walls bejeweled of hand fashioned silvers and colorful stone. I’m in El Alto near La Paz in Bolivia and the yatiri (witch doctors) are trying to sell me readings.

Potions, dried frogs, flowers, amulets, among them a sign labeled “llama fetus.” The shop owner tells me that the llama fetuses are burned in an offering to a goddess revered by the indigenous people of the Andes, Pachamama. Mother Earth. Pachamama was the mother of Inti the sun god and, after conquest by the Spanish, was merged with the Virgin Mary, who also births the sun/son singularly. Similarly to the Greek god Gaia, Pachamama marries her son Inti and births the gods and beings that make up the rest of the world.

Myths have always seemed less like stories of the gods to me, than stories of us. The story of creation, the story of birth. The story of knowledge being our undoing; the trait that drew us out of the divine world we previously inhabited. 

Knowledge took away our ability to discover, prevented us from seeking, it divided things between the categories of good and bad and separated what we wanted from what we could have. This trip has been an exercise in following my deeply buried inner child, the light inside that I was fully, before being raised wearing a mask to fit into society and to distinguish between good and bad. I place one of the fetuses on the coals to burn and ask for lost feelings to be brought back to me.
