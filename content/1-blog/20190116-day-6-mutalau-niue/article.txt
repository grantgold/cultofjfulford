Today I’m on Niue Island, a 101 sq mi coral atoll in the south Pacific, where the warm summer sun peeked out of the Huvalu forest at 5:54am. 

Deep in the forest there is a chasm in the rocks called the Togo Chasm, of which I have seen photos. There is a tall and sturdy ladder there to help people into the chasm, made from massive wood poles and I wanted to know what hero put it there to allow everyone such convenient access to this deep rift in the rock. When I called the local tourism office which provides information on the trails, they didn’t seem to have an answer and sadly have still not gotten back to me. 

It seems from their size that the poles of wood may be made from coconut trees. Indeed a meaningful material in that the coconut tree, called “Niu” in Niue, is very important here where they grow larger than anywhere else in the South Pacific. But the coconut was not always a part of life on Niue – which itself translates to “behold the coconut”. 

A Journal of the Polynesian Society book of 1902 titled “Niue and It’s People” (by S. Percy Smith and Pulekula, a teacher at Tama-ha-le-leka) tells the traditional story from about 200 years prior of a man who discovered a coconut that washed up on shore. Not knowing what it was, he left it in a corner of his house under a floor mat. He then went away to help in one of the wars of the time and upon his return found the husk had grown roots and leaves, itself becoming part of his house in Mutalau, sprouting coconuts in abundance. The man is credited with being a provider for the island where all the trees are supposedly derived from him. 

Many mythical stories of the coconut’s origin exist in Niue’s history however it is surely here because of its staple use in the heyday of seafaring explorers. When the great being that glides on water makes landfall, he passes around a hard and dense ball to the people of your village that provides them with high-calorie food and sweet potable water. He seems to have an endless supply with him. What do you do but honor him with songs and stories and tell of his greatness to your children?
