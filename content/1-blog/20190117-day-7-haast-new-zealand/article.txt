After starting my day at the Heritage Park Lodge in Haast, New Zealand I drove North on the highway, tracing the western coast along a shore of scenic cliff outlooks, lush forests and watershed rivers from the mountainous terrain to the south east. 

The edges of the land that I could see, like a pizza slice, left me wanting just a slightly bigger bite and since I couldn't see beyond the forest and my car couldn't make it through to the lookout points, I chose to enhance my view with the cheapest of 5 helicopter tours provided by (link: https://www.heliservices.nz/ text: HeliServicesNZ) ($99 for 10 minutes along the coast). 

We took off and flew right back towards where I started, south east along the coast. Through the fog, three criss-crossing lines etched into the earth not a mile from shore to form a landing field. Haast Aerodrome, still operational and owned by a local named Laurie McGuire, was listed for sale recently in the Otago Daily Times (the local newspaper). $20 landing fee as verified in November 2018 by the Aeronautical Information Publication of New Zealand. 

The view was stunning but since I didn’t take any photographs I’m including one (that I marked up to show the landing strip) by an airman named Paul Beauchamp-Legg, taken in 1958 from the same approach that I saw facing the airstrip coming from the north west. Likely taken while flying his WWII DH.89 Dominie from his home in the Marlborough Sounds. He apparently made the trip dozens of times. I sent a note of my condolences and my fondness for his photographs to The New Zealand Herald who published (link: http://notices.nzherald.co.nz/obituaries/NZHerald-NZ/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&pid=185705825 text: his obituary) in June of 2017.

Below you can find a video I took from my helicopter ride along the coast and arrival at the Haast Aerodrome as well as technical information for the airstrip.
