Grilled banana leaves filled with dried fish, red chili, cassava leaves, and turmeric paste. Ikan pepes of spicy, dry, and salty herbal fish. I was drawn here for the pleasures of food shared by my friend Umi, who is from Jakarta. My taste for the fish led me deeper into western Sumatra to the harbor of Lake Singkarak, where this particular fish was harvested. Known here as Ikan bilih (mystacoleucus padangensis), a minnow-like fish illustrated by the Dutch ichthyologist, Pieter Bleeker in 1852.

Ducking under roofs is fun but useless. Full-size poncho in the rain that has poured itself from the heavens a not insubstantial weight. Iâ€™ve gained 15lbs of water. A winding road led away from the lake and uphill towards a peak which I followed for the view. Aripan, a small paved road with water drainage simplified difficulties of the hike and released the taught grip of my shoulders to feel at ease in these sodden fabrics. 

Striped white shirts, bright beige pants, and red dresses dancing on sticks in the deep fields of waving grass, winds gave them the look of disheveled artists. Friendly scarecrows on this lonely path of self-stacking goats, while the warm sun lights the clouds for a few brief moments of... Respite. Spite. Despite. My bear is a hot bath, ceramic protection affixed to the floor and a locked door that keeps my family out. 

A tomb from the road protected by a skeleton structure of wood, the puffed rice snacks in my back are like lucky charms and I savor them. A woman piling sticks, she wears a black hijab and eyes me as I pass. An old rusted motorcycle and sidecar, constructions of bamboo walkways that float above the grasses around the banana trees. A farmer shares with me the thin bark he is peeling from a tree. Stings of spice pins in my nose, a shell of hardened red twig. Now that is cinnamon.
