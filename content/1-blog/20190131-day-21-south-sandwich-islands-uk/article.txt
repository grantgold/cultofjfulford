Off the coast of Antarctica and South America sits a string of islands called the South Sandwich Islands where I am today; named for their cardinal relation to the Sandwich Islands (known today as Hawaii). Both sets of islands were named by Capt. James Cook for John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich.

In his time Montagu was an important British statesman holding many titles, though you surely know of him for his claim to be the eponymous inventor of the esteemed snack. Supposedly, Lord Montagu requested salted beef between slices of bread to keep him satiated during his long bouts of gambling, and others at the table would say “same as Sandwich for me.” Like many names, the etymological sources are illusive and the credibility they hold increases relative to the amount of time documented; holding even more import when the names are used … by the wealthy.

The Patagonian toothfish, found in this region of the southern hemisphere, were unknown of until the 1970s when fishermen started using deepwater lines. A young fish merchant from LA named Lee Lantz started to find the fish in his catches near the South Sandwich Islands. He knew that the name toothfish wouldn’t sell in the U.S., nor would bacalao de profundidad (their local name which means cod of the deep). So despite its classification as a cod, he called it Chilean sea bass.

For three years he couldn’t sell the fish. Finally he found a food seller that had a problem with the price of halibut. Halibut had become too expensive to put in the fishsticks he was selling and Lee suggested using his Chilean sea bass. Over the next decade the fish caught on, appearing in restaurants all around the world, even famously at the Four Seasons in New York. 

If you look through my research (available on the site) you will find that the South Sandwich Islands economy is largely supported by the fishing of Antarctic toothfish. The Antarctic toothfish is also labeled as Chilean sea bass, an even cheaper version of the Patagonian toothfish sold as sea bass. Names are funny.⁣

Attached is an illustration of the  different fish labeled or sold as sea bass.
