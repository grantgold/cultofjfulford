A welcome change in temperature at 68ºF. Today I’m on Isla Tiburón, formed millions of years ago when the San Andreas fault split open, it is located 1.6 km from the eastern coast of Sonora, in the Midriff Island region of the Gulf of California.

Likely named for its dorsalesque point on the South West coast of the island (Tiburón means “shark” in Spanish). It is the largest island in Mexico and has the greatest diversity of mammals and reptiles of any island in the Gulf which is what drew me to it. The ‘Albatross Expedition,’ led by a zoologist named C.H. Townsend, describes 259 specimens representing 59 species thought to be undiscovered. One specific discovery, to this day found nowhere else but Isla Tiburón, was a subspecies of coyote that he named *canis latrans jamesi* for Mr. Arthur Curtiss James of New York who funded the deep-sea cooperative expedition of the USS Albatross in 1911.

*Canis jamesi* compared to others in the canis latrans species is described as smaller, but with a larger skull, having larger teeth, a more richly colored reddish coat and a documented ability to swim, surviving on a wide ranging diet of scavenged sea life such as fin whales and Humboldt squid.

According to a researcher from the Kino Bay Center for Cultural and Ecological Studies there has been no documentation of coyotes capturing large live sea-birds. However, in December 2009 that researcher observed, on the West side of Isla Tiburón a group of over a 1,000 blue-footed and brown-footed boobies just off shore. The birds were foraging about 10m deep to reach shoals of *clupeiform* fish when one of the island’s coyotes dashed over from more than 100m away, diving a few meters into the water and capturing one of the boobies shaking it violently while the bird pecked at its face. Within one minute *canis jamesi* was taking its prey back into the brush.

Sadly I failed to find anything connecting Mr. Arthur Curtiss James to an insatiable appetite for boobies.
